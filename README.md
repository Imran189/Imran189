I remember when I first started reading programming books years ago. I would get so frustrated because I just wanted to build these cool websites like the ones you see online.
But when I Started to learn coding it was really fun. And Now I can make the web sites that I was dreamed before. Learning Full-Stack was not to much easy, even I am learning every day and enjoying.

Skills: Laravel/VUE JS / JS / HTML / CSS/Bootstrap
